19)Data Governance in synapse:
Supports fine-grained access controls via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Synapse RBAC roles
Column-Level Security:
Restrict access to sensitive columns within tables to specific users or roles.
Row-Level Security (RLS):
Apply filters to restrict user access to specific rows in a table based on their roles.
Data Classification and Sensitivity Labels
Integrates with Microsoft Purview to classify and label data.
Sensitivity labels are applied to datasets for better visibility and control over sensitive information.
Enables tracking of sensitive data access and usage.

Data Lineage and Impact Analysis
Through Microsoft Purview, you can:
Track the lineage of data as it flows through pipelines, databases, and transformations.
Understand the impact of changes to data pipelines or schemas.

Dynamic Data Masking:
Automatically masks sensitive data in query results for unauthorized users.

Encryption:
Data at rest is encrypted using Transparent Data Encryption (TDE).
Data in transit is encrypted via TLS.

Compliance:
Synapse adheres to industry standards and certifications like GDPR,

Audit and Monitoring
Synapse Analytics Audit Logs:
Monitor data access, query executions, and pipeline activities for compliance and troubleshooting.
Azure Monitor and Log Analytics:
Gain insights into system performance, usage patterns, and anomalies.
Data Sharing and Access
Azure Synapse Data Sharing:
Share data securely within and across organizations using Azure Data Share.

1. Distributed and Resilient Architecture
Azure Synapse is built on a distributed architecture where:
Data is split into distributed partitions across multiple nodes.
Queries and workloads are executed in parallel on these distributed nodes.
This design ensures that even if one node fails, the system can redistribute the workload to healthy nodes.
2. Automatic Data Replication
Synapse ensures fault tolerance with multiple replicas of data stored in Azure Storage.
Primary Replica: Actively used for queries and processing.
Secondary Replica: Maintained for redundancy and disaster recovery.
Replicas are stored in geo-redundant storage to protect against regional failures.
The data replication process ensures that there is no single point of failure.
3. Query Execution Fault Tolerance
Queries in Synapse are broken into smaller tasks and distributed across nodes.
If a node fails during query execution:
The affected task is automatically retried on a healthy node.
This minimizes the impact of transient or hardware-related failures on query completion.
4. High Availability
Synapse is designed to provide 99.9% SLA uptime.
Features like hot standby nodes and load balancing ensure that system failures do not result in downtime.

5. Data Recovery Mechanisms
Point-in-Time Restore:
Synapse allows you to restore data warehouses to a previous state using automated snapshots.
Snapshots are taken periodically and can be used to recover data lost due to accidental deletion or corruption.
Backup and Restore:
Automated backups are taken at regular intervals and stored in durable Azure Blob Storage.
You can manually trigger backups for additional protection.

8. Fault-Tolerant Pipelines
Synapse Pipelines (powered by Azure Data Factory) include:
Retry Policies: Automatically retries failed activities with customizable retry counts and intervals.
Checkpointing: Saves progress during data movement or transformation tasks to resume from the last checkpoint in case of failure.
9. Monitoring and Alerts
Azure Monitor and Log Analytics:
Provide real-time monitoring and alerts for performance and system health.
Alerts help detect and resolve potential issues before they escalate into failures.
Query Performance Insights:
Identifies long-running or failed queries, allowing quick diagnosis and optimization.

How Fault Tolerance Operates in Common Scenarios
Scenario 1: Node Failure
A Synapse compute node fails during a query execution.
The system:
Automatically redistributes the tasks to other available nodes.
Ensures minimal query disruption through task retries.
Scenario 2: Data Corruption
A block of data becomes corrupted in storage.
Synapse:
Automatically detects and repairs the corrupted block using redundant copies from other replicas.
Scenario 3: Regional Outage
An entire Azure region becomes unavailable.
Synapse:
Switches to a geo-redundant copy of the data in a different region.
Ensures that workloads continue with minimal downtime.
Best Practices for Enhancing Fault Tolerance in Synapse
Enable Geo-Redundant Storage:

For critical data, enable GZRS (Geo-Zone Redundant Storage) to replicate data across regions.
Set Up Alerts:

Use Azure Monitor to set up alerts for failures, high resource usage, or slow queries.
Use Retry Policies:

Configure retry policies in Synapse Pipelines to handle transient failures gracefully.
Backup Regularly:

Schedule regular manual backups in addition to automated snapshots.
Optimize Queries:

Break large queries into smaller, manageable tasks to reduce the impact of failures.
Leverage Azure Synapse Link:

For hybrid fault-tolerant scenarios, integrate Synapse with Azure Cosmos DB or other transactional systems.
